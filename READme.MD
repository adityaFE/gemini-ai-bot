Added a test feature inside the codebase. 
Just turn the flag `TEST_MODE` true to enable the test mode. You will not actually hit the api but get back a dummy data. 
Right now it is hardcoded inside the js file.

2. Make the suggestions dynamic 
3. Allow multi line typing in the prompt form (Right now everything you type goes in a single line.)
